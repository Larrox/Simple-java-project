* Projects can be submitted till January ???, 11:59:59 PM (BitBucket server time). All contributions made after deadline will result in failing project (hence failing course).
* Submitting project before deadline is required to be admitted to oral exam.
* Not submitting project before deadline will result in failing laboratories (hence failing course).
* Subject (what the application actually does) it totally up to student. If for any reason student has a problem with choosing application subject, he or she can ask for assistance project verificators.
* Each student is obliged to create fork of this repository and make all contributions to it. Contributions made to original repository (f.e. pull requests) or send via other channels (like email) won't be accepted.
* Only source code, resources and so should be pushed to repository.
* Application must be created using Maven (version 3.X.Y) and project verificators must be able to build it using standard commands (like 'mvn compile' and 'mvn package').

	* project author name,
	* description of what project does (in just a few sentences),
	* instructions how to compile and run application,
	* all additional information needed for application usage.

* Project needs to have at least 2-level class inheritance present (regardless if base class is abstract or not).
* Example of using class field polymorphic binding needs to be present in the source code.
* Usage of at least two custom interfaces is mandatory.
